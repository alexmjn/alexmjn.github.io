title: Predicting Clearance Rates of Serious Crimes
---

# Summary

I used data from The Trace on 747,000 criminal incidents to investigate what factors were associated with whether or not a crime got cleared.


# Analysis

I found that the two biggest factors in prediction were whether a crime involved firearms and what city the crime occurred in. 
Gun crime is dramatically less likely to be cleared. And, even controlling for higher rates of gun crime, struggling cities seem to suffer both from a high rate of crime and a low rate of clearing each individual crime.
