title: Content Moderation for Allay
---

# Collaborative Project: Allay

## Goals

Allay is a website in development that serves as a Lambda School-specific job board as well as a way of connecting
alumni and students. I worked with a team of eight web developers, two other data scientists, and a UX designer in
order to continue to build out the website. The data science project we undertook was to develop a workable content
moderation system that could be deployed as an API within the website pipeline to score and identify inappropriate
content before users would see that content and be driven from the site.

## Summary



## Analysis

I found that the two biggest factors in prediction were whether a crime involved firearms and what city the crime occurred in.
Gun crime is dramatically less likely to be cleared. And, even controlling for higher rates of gun crime, struggling cities seem to suffer both from a high rate of crime and a low rate of clearing each individual crime.
[I wrote up analysis in more detail here.](https://medium.com/@ajenkneary/clearing-out-crime-4b1267f7274d).
