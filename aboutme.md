title: About Me
---

Languages: Python, SQL
Packages (or, at least, the ones I work most with): Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn

I graduated from Centre College in 2012 with a B.S. in Mathematics and in Economics. I spent seven years working in an accounting firm before deciding to make a leap and pursue a career that would challenge me and was more aligned with my natural interests. I started Lambda School's data science program in November 2019 and finished in September 2020.

When I'm not programming, I love playing soccer, writing, and reading (primarily fiction). [My Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62754782-alex-jn): my favorite authors are Donald Barthelme and Vladimir Nabokov, and I'm always looking for new book recommendations!
