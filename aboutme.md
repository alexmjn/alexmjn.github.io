I graduated from Centre College in 2012 with a B.S. in Mathematics and in Economics. I spent seven years working in an accounting firm before deciding to make a leap and pursue a career that would challenge me and was more aligned with my natural interests. I started Lambda School's data science program in November 2019 and finished in September 2020.

When I'm not programming, I love playing soccer, writing, and reading, especially fiction.
